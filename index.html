		<h1><br>About this Site: </h1>
		<p1>The description of the site will likely change as the site changes, as I wanted to write this early and still have a lot of work to do. 
			This site is primarly created using HTML and CSS. The purpose is both to learn HTML & CSS, as well as hosting and publishing sites.
			I am using AWS to host which is also a new technology to me. As I expand this site I hope to employ and 
			learn new technologies or become more advanced with what I know currently<br><br>	
			This site will also be used to display my personal portfolio of projects and provide some relevant social links. Happy viewing!</p1>
