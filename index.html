		<h1><br>About this Site: </h1>
		<p1>The description of the site will likely change as the site changes, as I wanted to write this early and still have a lot of work to do. 
			This site is primarly created using HTML and CSS. The purpose is both to learn HTML & CSS, as well as hosting and publishing sites, as 
			I am using AWS to host and is an opportunity to learn more technologies as well. As I expand this site I also might employ and 
			learn new technologies or become more advance with what I know currently<br><br>	
			This site will also be used to display my personal portfolio of projects and provide some relevant social links. Happy viewing!</p1>
